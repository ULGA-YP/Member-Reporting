One of the painpoints with having a large number of members in a non-profit organization is to find the best possible ways to engage 
and interact with your members in meaningful ways.  To this end, at roughly 300+ members, we needed to find a way to first off, unlock our data for usage purposes, and then to untangle it for reporting purposes.  

Our member data lived in a tool called "Wild Apricot", which luckily had API functionality.  There were a few examples of this on the web, but nothing specifically made it easy for us to move do it effectively.  Since we are a non-profit, we needed a pathway that was inexpensive, reproducable, and somewhat straightforward.  Enter Google!  Using Google Sheets and some java scripts, we were able to create a seamless view of our members for reporting purposes.

This script will show how we approached this problem and solved it with a couple of lines of code.
